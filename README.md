# RedWineQualityClassification
Using Machine Learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a good quality wine and classify wines as 'good' or 'bad'.
Abstract:

In this project, we applied machine learning algorithms to classify red
wines as either "good" or "bad" based on their chemical and physical
properties. We used a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository to train our models and achieved an accuracy of 91% on
our test data. Our results show that machine learning can be an
effective tool for wine quality classification.

Results:

We used two different machine learning algorithms - Random Forest,
and Support Vector Machines - to classify red wines as either "good"
or "bad" based on 12 Behavioral variables. We achieved an accuracy
of 90% on our test data using all two algorithms. Random Forest
however, achieved the highest accuracy, with a score of 91%. Our
results show that machine learning can be an effective tool for wine
quality classification.
